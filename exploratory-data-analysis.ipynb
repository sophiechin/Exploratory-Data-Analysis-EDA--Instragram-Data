Introduction\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental aspect of Data Science, involving the thorough examination of a dataset to unveil underlying patterns, trends, and associations. This process enhances our comprehension of the dataset's content and aids in making informed choices and devising effective approaches for addressing tangible business challenges. In this notebook, I will lead you through a practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis utilizing the Python programming language.\n\nTo begin with the EDA process, I will use the dataset about Instagram Reach and this dataset could be found [HERE](https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/).\n\nOverall, the dataset consists of the total of 119 rows and 13 columns with the column details as the following:\n\n1. Impressions: Count of post views (Reach)\n2. Home Reach: Reach originating from the home feed\n3. Hashtag Reach: Reach resulting from hashtags\n4. Explore Reach: Reach generated by appearing on the Explore page\n5. Other Reach: Reach from sources other than the aforementioned\n6. Saves: Total saves of the post\n7. Comments: Total comment count\n8. Shares: Total number of shares\n9. Likes: Total number of likes received\n10. Profile Visits: Count of visits to the profile via the post\n11. Follows: Number of new followers gained through the post\n12. Caption: Text accompanying the post\n13. Utilized Hashtags: Hashtags employed in the post\n\nDisclaimer: This notebook is for my learning and practice purpose only, and the source code I run here is referenced from [THIS GUIDE](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2023/05/30/exploratory-data-analysis-using-python/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.templates.default = \"plotly_white\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-22T06:32:00.252182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-22T06:32:00.253419Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-22T06:32:00.284115Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-22T06:32:00.253370Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-22T06:32:00.282760Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# II.

The dominant share of reach from the user's home feed implies that a substantial portion of the audience is engaging with posts directly through their feeds.

This suggests that users find value in the content posted, often saving it for future reference or re-viewing.\n- On the other hand, engagement through post Shares and Comments is comparatively lower, collectively accounting for less than 3% of the total engagement.\n\nHence, the pie chart underscores the central role of Likes and Saves in driving engagement for Instagram posts.
